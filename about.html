          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            MedEz Anatomy Explorer is built to deliver clear, reliable anatomical education for students,
            clinicians, and lifelong learners. We focus on accuracy, relevance, and clarity so that every concept
            you study can be meaningfully applied in academic and clinical settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of overwhelming detail, we prioritize essential relationships, clinical context, and a learning
            experience that respects your time and attention.
